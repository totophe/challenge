#Knowledge Plaza Front-End Challenge

Knowledge Plaza, a fun Belgian startup, is looking for talents to join the team and help build the best social network for companies. Want to join? Let's try this little challenge!

The goal of this challenge is to learn, to have fun and to test if you would have fun working at Knowledge Plaza. If you apply for a Junior position, the code you will write is a lot less important than the way you approach an unknown problem.

##Description of the challenge

You are asked to write a small web application that display a dynamic stream of "tiles". Each tile is an exerpt of a piece of content. Tiles may have tags. 

The stream should be filterable by tags and/or by plain search. Your application will also allow your user to create a tile that will be displayed immediately in the stream.

The initial content is described as a list of tiles in the attached JSON file. Each tile has multiple properties but you may only consider using tile.title and tile.tags. Others are optional, but we are eager to see your creativity!

In the example above, each tile is a rectangle. The color is determined by tile.subtype, then tile.title, tile.description and tile.tags are displayed.

The right column allows to filter content in the first box. The second box allows to create a tile with a title and tags but no description.

##Technical specifications

We are asking you to create a private (or somewhat secret) git repository with your code. We strongly recommend the use of an existing framework surch as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

We expect the code to be readable and to have unit tests. We recommend [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/)+[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) but you can use [MochaJS](http://mochajs.org/) or the framework of your choice.

In order to see how you work, we are interested in seeing each commit. A big dump of your project to github in one commit is not a good idea.

Afterwards, send a link to your repository to l.dricot@knowledgeplaza.net.
